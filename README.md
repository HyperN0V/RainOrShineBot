# RainOrShine Discord Bot

## What does it do?

RainOrShine is a minimalistic but sleek bot developed with Python that will provide you with the current real-time weather status.

This bot utilizes the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com) to pull from to represent the figures shown by the bot when utilizing the "$weather" bot command.

It displays the current temperature (displays both °C and °F), the humidity level in percent(%), the UV index, and lastly the current weather condition.

More development is underway to create more commands for the bot which provides a fully functional all-in-one weather bot.
